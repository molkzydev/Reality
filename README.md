### What Data Does Aero Collect?

Currently, the Reality bot has limited functionality, and we do not require extensive data storage. We only collect one essential piece of information to ensure smooth operation:

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :-------------: |
| Server IDs     | To track saved server settings and playlist configurations. |

### Do We Share Our Collected Data with Anyone?

We do **NOT** share any user data. We understand the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting your information.

### How Can I Delete My Data?

You have three primary options for deleting your data:

1. **Contact the Developer:** Reach out to the developer on Discord (rajan_.sumant) with your User ID or Server ID. Your data will be deleted as soon as the developer is available.
  
2. **Join Our Discord Support Server:** Use the `support` command to join our Discord Support Server. Once there, go to the `#chat` channel and describe your issue. Our support team will assist you within 20 minutes.
  
3. **Use In-Bot Settings:** Some settings allow you to disable or delete stored data directly. If you donâ€™t see an option, please try one of the first two methods mentioned above.
